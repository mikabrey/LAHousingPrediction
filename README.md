Foreclosure prediction using machine learning
Multiple Linear Regression/GradientBoostingRegressor/Ridge Regression
.
Problem Statement
The goal of the analysis is to help us understanding the relation between unemployment rate/ income/ foreclosure and how zip code are used to determine it.  I hope that creating a model will help predict foreclosure in near future.  I also create recommended zip code for the home seeker in his early thirties who likes to go to coffee shops and like outdoor sports.
